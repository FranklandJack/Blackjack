# Blackjack
A text based game where the user plays the card game "Black Jack" against the computer. I wrote this code when I was teaching myself C++ from the website www.learncpp.com. This is an exercise from one of the chapter summaries.

To build; run ```$ make```

To play; run ```$ ./Blackjack```

For a full list of ```make``` functionality, including how to generate documentation, run ```$ make help```.
